# GraphicCodeHub - Flask Project

## Introduction
GraphicCodeHub is a web application developed using the Flask framework and Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. The project aims to provide a platform for sharing and discussing graphic design codes, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets. Users can create accounts, upload their code snippets, explore others' code, and engage in discussions within the community.

## Features
- User Registration: Users can create accounts to access the platform and participate in discussions.
- Code Upload: Users can upload their graphic design code snippets, categorize them, and provide descriptions.
- Code Exploration: Users can browse through various code snippets uploaded by other users, filter by categories, and view code details.
- Discussion Forum: Users can participate in discussions related to specific code snippets, ask questions, provide feedback, and share ideas.
- User Profiles: Each user has a profile page displaying their uploaded code snippets and contributions to discussions.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for specific code snippets, users, or topics within the platform.
